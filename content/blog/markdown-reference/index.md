If you haven't used markdown for a while, it's common that you forgot the syntax and the nuances of the language 🙄. Frankly speaking, with markdown, there's more than one way to achieve an outcome for e.g. headings.

I know what you're saying...for god's sake, why don't you have a quick reference guide or something and that's exactly what i did over in Github.

Here you go -> [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/jvikraman/markdown-cheatsheet)

🤗 Phew! one less thing to worry about.
